## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-23

### üßπ Repository Architecture Cleanup

This release focuses on simplifying the repository architecture by removing speculative vector database implementations and focusing on a robust SQLite-only foundation.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Enhanced ContentRepositoryInterface** - Added `getCapabilities()` and `supports()` methods for feature discovery
- **Repository Capability System** - Standardized way to query repository features
- **Improved Error Handling** - More comprehensive exception handling in repository operations

### üîÑ Changed
- **Simplified Architecture** - Removed speculative Weaviate/vector database implementations
- **SQLite Focus** - Concentrated on making SQLite repository production-ready
- **Library Best Practices** - Added `composer.lock` to `.gitignore` for better library distribution

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- **Weaviate Dependencies** - Removed `zestic/weaviate-php-client` and related code
- **Vector Database Code** - Removed speculative vector repository implementations
- **Unused Directories** - Cleaned up empty migration and storage directories
- **composer.lock** - Removed from version control (library best practice)

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Cleaner Codebase** - Reduced from 6,684 lines to focused, maintainable code
- **Better Testing** - All 315 tests passing with improved repository coverage
- **Enhanced Documentation** - Updated architecture documentation to reflect simplified approach

### üìä Impact
- **Code Reduction** - Removed 6,684 lines of speculative code
- **Focused Implementation** - Single, robust SQLite repository implementation
- **Better Maintainability** - Cleaner, more focused codebase
- **Production Ready** - Solid foundation for real-world usage

### üéØ Philosophy Shift
This release represents a strategic decision to avoid over-engineering and focus on delivering a solid, tested foundation. Vector database capabilities will be added when there's genuine demand, ensuring every line of code serves a real purpose.

### üìù Migration Notes
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- All existing functionality preserved
- Repository interface enhanced with capability discovery
- Tests and documentation updated accordingly
